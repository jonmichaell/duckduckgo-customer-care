If you’re wondering how to get in touch with DuckDuckGo Customer Care, this
document will guide you through the best ways to reach out, what to expect, and
how to avoid common pitfalls—all while respecting your privacy.

Why There Is No DuckDuckGo Customer Care Phone Number
-----------------------------------------------------

Unlike many companies, DuckDuckGo does not provide a public phone number for
customer support. This is an intentional choice aligned with their strong
privacy commitment.

- DuckDuckGo avoids collecting personal data required for phone support  
- There is no need to verify identities via calls, preserving anonymity  
- Support is designed to be efficient without compromising user privacy

This means that if you are searching for a DuckDuckGo Customer Care number, you
won’t find one through official channels.

How to Reach DuckDuckGo Customer Care
-------------------------------------

Although there is no phone number, DuckDuckGo offers effective support through
several other channels:

1. Self-Help Documentation
   ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   DuckDuckGo provides comprehensive help articles covering topics such as:

   - Setting DuckDuckGo as your default search engine  
   - Using the mobile app and browser extensions  
   - Managing privacy and tracker blocking settings  
   - Troubleshooting common issues

   These resources are often sufficient to resolve many questions quickly.

2. Email Support

   For issues not covered by the help documentation, you can contact DuckDuckGo
   Customer Care via email. When doing so, include:

   - A clear description of the issue  
   - Device type and operating system  
   - Browser or app version  
   - Steps you’ve taken to resolve the problem

   Detailed information helps the support team assist you promptly and
   accurately.

3. Feedback Submission
   ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   DuckDuckGo also encourages users to submit feedback through in-app forms or
   website options. This is ideal for reporting bugs, suggesting improvements,
   or sharing general thoughts. While this may not always result in a direct
   response, the feedback influences ongoing development.

Avoiding Fake DuckDuckGo Customer Care Phone Numbers

are almost always scams aiming to deceive users.

  unsolicited sources
